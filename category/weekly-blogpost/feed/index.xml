				<description><![CDATA[The cruise adventures have ended, but that does not mean mine have as well. I had a flight on Friday the 13th from Miami to Boston. After having arrived to our airbnb I got reunited with the people I haven&#8217;t seen in a week. Of course being the 13th, bad luck had to hit me. &#8230; <a href="/2020/01/06/cambridge-new-york-washington-dc/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Cambridge &#038; New York &#038; Washington DC</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

It&#8217;s Tuesday, we would embark on George Town, Cayman Islands. We ended up going to the beach after visiting some shops where we could snorkel for a &#8230; <a href="/2020/01/06/week-18-part-2-cayman-islands/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Cayman Islands &#038; Mexico &#038; the Bahamas (part 2 of the cruise adventures)</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The first sight of the cruise: it&#8217;s gigantic!!! There are 5000 passengers and 1250 crewmembers aboard. We started with going to the buffet, which I could describe with only one word: amazing! There were sooo many food options and it is all included. More expensive cheeses like manchego were available and a large variety of &#8230; <a href="/2020/01/06/week-18-part-1-cruise-adventures-begin/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Cruise adventures begin (part 1)</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[To wrap up the Miami experience: On Saturday we rented a 7-person minivan and used that to first go to an airboat tour organized by a local Miccosukee tribe. We saw a lot of gators and the tour guide was not afraid to interact with these alligators, even grabbing one below its beak!

On Tuesday morning, we got ready to leave with the car to&#8230; Miami! We left at 7AM to avoid all the traffic that would be &#8230; <a href="/2019/12/02/week-16-miami/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 16: Miami</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

This is an event with supposedly 10.000 dollar budget and I already got the see the preparation: The destruction of a nice field of grass which has had a short year to grow back.

It is an exhausting 8-9 hour drive but luckily I am not one of the drivers, 3 others are, (you need &#8230; <a href="/2019/11/17/week-14-new-orleans/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 14: New Orleans</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

Before this, we went to see the sunset at the Ecopassage Observatory Boardwalk, and took some beautiful pictures there. In Cedar Key we walked to the observation deck, which apparently was not empty &#8230; <a href="/2019/11/08/week-13-cedar-key/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 13: Cedar Key</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

With Didier and Gina we gathered on time to watch them. As a real veteran, I brought a umbrella against the guano.
