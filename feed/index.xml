				<description><![CDATA[To wrap up the Miami experience: On Saturday we rented a 7-person minivan and used that to first go to an airboat tour organized by a local Miccosukee tribe. We saw a lot of gators and the tour guide was not afraid to interact with these alligators, even grabbing one below its beak!

On Tuesday morning, we got ready to leave with the car to&#8230; Miami! We left at 7AM to avoid all the traffic that would be &#8230; <a href="/2019/12/02/week-16-miami/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 16: Miami</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

This is an event with supposedly 10.000 dollar budget and I already got the see the preparation: The destruction of a nice field of grass which has had a short year to grow back.

It is an exhausting 8-9 hour drive but luckily I am not one of the drivers, 3 others are, (you need &#8230; <a href="/2019/11/17/week-14-new-orleans/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 14: New Orleans</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[On Saturday, my friend Dani organized a trip towards Cedar Key city, which is an hour and a half away from Gainesville. Before this, we went to see the sunset at the Ecopassage Observatory Boardwalk, and took some beautiful pictures there. In Cedar Key we walked to the observation deck, which apparently was not empty &#8230; <a href="/2019/11/08/week-13-cedar-key/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Week 13: Cedar Key</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

Origami, Japanese calligraphy as well as Japanese food were offered at this event. Also a chopstick contest was happening where I won a manual hand fan.

With Didier and Gina we gathered on time to watch them. As a real veteran, I brought a umbrella against the guano.

				<description><![CDATA[There are a lot of springs near Gainesville, so it would be a shame not to go to any. Two friends and I made plans to go to Devil&#8217;s Den. This place is an underwater cave with scuba-diving options. But we rented snorkeling equipment instead, it was such a beautiful experience!

First of all, I have been to all other games, and no I was not sick during this one.

It was fun nonetheless, and I met some amazing people before the game started. And they had an amazing half-time show with fire!!
